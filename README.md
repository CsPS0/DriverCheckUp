## DriverCheckUp
DriverCheckUp is a simple Python script that uses the WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) API to check if all the drivers installed on a Windows PC are up to date. It compares the version and release date of each driver with the latest available version from the manufacturer's website.

## Requirements
To run the DriverCheckUp script, you need to have the following software installed on your Windows PC:

- Python 3.6 or later
- The wmi module for Python (you can install it using pip: `pip install wmi`)
## Usage
To use DriverCheckUp, simply run the main.py script from a command prompt or terminal:
`python main.py`,     
The script will output one of the following messages:

- "All drivers are up to date." if all drivers are up to date.
- "Some drivers are not up to date." if one or more drivers are outdated.
If some drivers are outdated, the script will also list their names in the output.

## Customization
You can customize DriverCheckUp to fit your needs by modifying the main.py script.
For example, you can implement the get_latest_driver_version() function to retrieve the latest driver version from the manufacturer's website for a given device ID. You can also change the logic that determines whether a driver is up to date or not.

## Disclaimer
DriverCheckUp is a simple tool that can help you check if your drivers are up to date, but it is not foolproof. It relies on the accuracy and completeness of the driver information provided by the WMI API and the manufacturer's website. It is always a good idea to manually check for driver updates and install them if necessary. Also, be careful when downloading and installing drivers from third-party websites, as they may contain malware or be outdated or incompatible with your hardware.
